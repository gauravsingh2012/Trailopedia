<h3 class="expandable">The Purpose of the SimpleProxy Utility and How to Use It</h3>

<div>

<p>
The design purpose for the SimpleProxy Utility is to provide a means
to bring in web data from a remote site and make the data available 
to a program.
</p>

<p>
The SimpleProxy Utility is installed as an <code>IHttpHandler</code>
so it may be called from any directory on this site.  The format
needed is:
</p>

<pre class="indent1">simpleproxy.aspx?url=|...|</pre>

<p>
Here ... is an embedded URL that specifies the remote data.
</p>

<p>
The goal is that Javascript on a client could make an AJAX call back
to its host on the IIS server, specify a simpleproxy URL with the
embedded URL in its query string, and then receive the data from the
embedded URL back on the client.
</p>

<p>
For testing purposes, it is really helpful to run the SimpleProxy
Utility interactively.  You then manually supply the embedded URL
and see what comes back.  Here is a link to do that:
</p>

<p class="indent1">
<a href="simpleproxy.aspx" target="_blank">Interactive SimpleProxy</a>
</p>

<p>
You will get an error message when you click the above link but that
is expected since you need to manually supply the embedded URL as
follows:
</p>

<pre class="indent1">.../simpleproxy.aspx?url=|...|</pre>

<p>
The vertical bar delimits the URL so you can have embedded query
parameters.  You may also use single or double quotes as delimiters.
</p>

<p>
The default content type for the data returned is
<code>text/plain</code>.
</p>

<p>
To specify the content type for the data returned as
<code>text/xml</code>, use:
</p>

<pre class="indent1">.../simpleproxy.aspx?xml&url=|...|</pre>

<p>
If the xml has a stylesheet and the stylesheet does not load
properly, then the window will be empty.  In this
case, try to use the browser "view source" option.
</p>

<p>
If, for testing purposes, you want the return data html encoded
and nested in <code>pre</code> tags, use:
</p>

<pre class="indent1">.../simpleproxy.aspx?pre&url=|...|</pre>

<p>
If you want to get web data for manipulation by C# on the server,
then there is a much simpler static call that suffices:
</p>

<pre class="indent1">string url = ...;
string data = SimpleProxy.GetResponseContent(url);</pre>

<p>
If an empty string is returned then there was an error or there was no
data.  You should then test using <b>Interactive SimpleProxy</b> above.
</p>

</div>

<h3 class="expandable">Limitations and Bugs</h3>

<div>

<ul>
  <li>
  The SimpleProxy utility returns the content delivered from a url as is.
  There is no attempt to inspect the content or to translate any relative
  URL&rsquo;s that may be embedded therein.
  </li>

  <li>
  The SimpleProxy utility implements no security.  The utility will request
  anything from anywhere.  Further, no usernames or passwords are required.
  </li>

  <li>
  Some valid URL&rsquo;s do not return data.  This appears to be due to
  the fact that the remote server rejects the HTTP request as generated
  by the Microsoft code I am using.  This requires further investigation.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>
For debugging, it may or may not help to use:
