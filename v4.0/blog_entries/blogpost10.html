<h1> More Database Experiments</h1>

<p>
    This week I explored more on Database Experiments as I needed to learn how to use asp forms to insert and delete values in
    the table. So I did two experiments in this week. One was to insert values into the database and the other was to edit values
    in the database.
</p>

<p>
    To achieve this I use Insert and Update Queries in the SQL Data source to insert and delete values with respect to my scenario
    that I want to achieve.
</p>

<p>
    I see this as a very useful experiment as one might need to create administrator pages for a website and check if all the 
    values in the database are correct or not.
