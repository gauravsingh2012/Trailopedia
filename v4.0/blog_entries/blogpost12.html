<h1> Closing Thoughts on the Project</h1>

<p>
   Finally, this project is complete and all I can say that I have learnt a lot of javascript in this course. Few techniques that I learnt 
   using jQuery was to make use of hidden fields to store ids and achieve my goal of calling api with the id parameter of the desired object.
   Another useful Technique that I learnt was to make use of the cloning feature extensively provided in jquery. One has to be very careful 
   with this feature as one needs to only clone the first element in the template as to avoid multiple templates with the same data being cloned.

    Well Now that the project is over I can say that my goal in this course was to understand responsive designs using @media queries and
    playing with percentages in blocks. Observe My Page on an iPhone, I was surprised to see that it actually works like a mobile app.
    One of my other goals in the project was to develop the website using only javascript as I believe that javascript is very powerful in developing websites.
