<h1> Project</h1>

<p>
    I started with my project last week but only to realize that Rotten Tomatoes Does not give me the desired searches that I need for my project.
    My project is based on viewing movie trailers only which I believe should not be user centric. It took me a while to find out the the 
    correct api that I needed to use for my project which is the movie DB API. This gives me all the youtube links of movie trailers and
    allows me to query videos from the API.

    I am completed with 50% of my project and I am still looking for two other APIS for news feeds and Finding out nearby movie theatres. This
    project is something that I really like and I feel is beneficial to me as I really like to watch a Trailer before I watch a Movie :).
