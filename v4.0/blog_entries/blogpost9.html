<h1> Database Experiment</h1>

<p>

    I did the database experiment this week. This experiment is about retrieving data from my database and displaying them in the webpage.
    The database connectivity will be very crucial in the project as I would require a login feature for users. 

    I have also added another Google Map API experiment which allows the user to provide user input. Although I do not require this experiment to take a user input for my
    contact page. But as it was a suggestion , I decided to add it.

    I am going to start with the project this week and make sure that my prototype is ready by the next week. I have also decided to explore the rotten tomatoes API
    to its full extent as I would need it to work with my Movie Trailers Project.
