<h1> CSS3 and jQuery Week</h1>

<p>
    This week , I worked with CSS3 in particular with web hition effects and radial Gradients. I needed a better background
    color for my page. I though the grey one looked good but then I think the blue color is much better and I will be incorporating this
    in my home page. I also noticed that jquery is a wonderful tool which can make life much easier. It can save time by avoiding a
    lot of javascript to be written.

<p>
    I got hold of a really cool thing in CSS3 which is @font-face property that lets you define and use your own font other than 
    the default fonts that the browser supports. Most of these experiments you will see being incorporated on my homepage.
