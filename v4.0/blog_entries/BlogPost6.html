<h1> Week for ASP Illustrations and API calls</h1>

<p>
    This week , I worked on ASP illustrations and API calls. The ASP experiments are very basic in nature and from what I understand that
    sometimes it is necessary with controller methods to diaplay dta dynamically. The data could be from a database as well. 
    The form sign ups can use the data from the text boxes and store them in the database and then can be used for signing in to
    a profile page.

    The API calls are a little tricky when it comes to calling from jquery. I used the Google Feed API to display RSS Feeds. I might use them
    to work with my projects or on my homepage. I am getting stuck with the rotten tomatoes API. I got my developer Key but now I am not
    able generate the content dynamically using jquery. I don't get the response from the API. I am still trying to find a fix for this.
    In the mean time , I did test out my api key which works as you can see in the experiment that there is link to the upcoming movies
    response from rotten tomatoes.

    This API is very crucial to me as my project is based on upcomiong movies movie trailers and I think in the coming week, my main
    focus would be on the Rotten Tomatoes API.
