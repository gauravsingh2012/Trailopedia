<h1> Week for home page development</h1>

<p>
    This week , I decided to work with my home page. Improved a lot of styling. One really interesting thing I observed with hover property was
    it is not possible to select the parent object of the child on the hover of child. Although it is possible to do the vice-versa, one 
    one needs to use javascript or jquery to give effect to the parent object of the child on hover of child
</p>

    This weeks experiment, I havn't decided yet. But I believe, I am reserving the Sunday Morning for that. Was probably thinking of 
    experimenting with ASP pages as now I am thinking of working my way through the projects.
