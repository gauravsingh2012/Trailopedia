<h1> Fixed Headers</h1>

<p>
    I thought that I needed a navigation bar at the top of my page to so it is easy to navigate between different
    links. A much convenient approach was to use div blocks and make their positions fixed with top as 0. So scroll down
    in Week 2 experiments, notice that the header remains fixed even if you scroll down.

    I used jquery for hiding the submenu which I could have done using CSS hover , but I think its sometimes good to make use of
    jquery effects as well.

    Closing thoughts on this weeks experiment. Watch out for my webpage I think it looks nice now :).
