<h1> Rotten Tomatoes Fix</h1>

<p>
    This week I am demonstrating experiments for my projects where I would need the rotten tomatoes API to retrieve information 
    about movie trailers. I can see the movie information that I want. To check whether the information is retrieved or not,
    check the console on the browser to see a list of retrieved objects.

    My Developer Key is still not active and once it is done i am pretty sure i can use the clips api from rotten tomatoes
    to retireve the trailers for the particular movie.
