<h1> Google Map API, Rotten Tomatoes API, Validations, Fix File Views</h1>

<p>
    Well Since now that my developer Key is active, I have started using my key now. I have made sure that when you search
    for a movie in the browser, all the movies are listed with their titles and images using object.length property of the 
    object retrieved.
    
    I have added validations in my previous experiments where I made use required validation and regular expression validator.
    I think the regular expression validator is more powerful than the standard validators provided by asp as it provides me
    more flexibility in terms of validating text boxes.

    Also, I have fixed the file viewing source Code. I hope this is the correct fix for this.

    For this weeks experiment. I worked with the Google MAP API. I want to use this API for my homegape development where
    I would have a contact me page and would like to display my location on the google map that would be embedded on the 
    page. The idea of my contact me page is to have my contact address on the page and use that address to locate me on the 
    map. This is one of the ideas that I have for my home page.
