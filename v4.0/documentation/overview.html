                            I decided to pick a movie trailers project for this course. The reason being is that I like
                            to watch trailers before I actually go and watch a movie. So I decided to query the movie DB API
                            to grab all the trailers and embed it in my page especially the movie that are about to release.
                        </p>

                        <br />

                        <p>
                            The Movie DB API offered me different categories of movies and tv shows to query. I could have used
                            rotten tomaotes but rotten tomatoes provides a link to the trailers and does not offer the URL of their
                            video trailers. So I opted for Movie DB as it offered me my desired results.
                        </p>

                        <br />

                        <p>
                            The Different features for movies that I queried were upcoming movies,top rated movies, popular movies,
                            now playing movies. The TV queries were On Air TV Shows, Popular TV Shows and Top Rated TV shows.
                            I was also able to query their details like cast,crew,reviews and ratings. Other Features include Searching
                            for a movie and TV. I thought if there is a movie buff, they also would like to know about news. So I added
                            news feed as well to the project from hollywood reporter.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This project was based on solely my interest and not customer centric. It is something I would definetly like to use
                            and hence I did not add any login features for a user. My main objective in this class was to understand
                            responsive design and I observed that my project can be viewed on an iphone as well.

                            The technologies that I have used are javascript,HTML and CSS to complete this project. I parse the
                            data in JSON format using ajax calls.
