                            There are of course a few bugs in my project. Everyone has them. Unfortunately I do not have a fix for
                            them. The API takes about a second or two to load my videos on the page. Although it is fine for someone
                            with a high speed internet but could be a problem for someone with low speed internets.

                        <p>
                            There is one weird anamoly in my page that when I click the back button from details page or trailers page
                            back to the any video page, I see elements there but not in the correct order. I don't Why that happens. I have
                            spent hours on debugging it but still havn't found a solution for this.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Obviously since I use API calls, I cannot have complete information. It would depend on the API's database whether
                            they have that information. So it is possible that some popular might end with no results but I have handled
                            cases for that to let the end user aware that it could not find the particular movie or TV show for you.

                            One Other Limitation that I have is that my search Theatre feature is a workaround. I enter the address of the
                            movie theatre and then display the location on the map. The original feature was to call fandango api and get
                            details of theatres using zip code parameter. But Since my developer key remains inactive, I decided to scrape this
                            feature from the project.

                            My Poster_default.gif image is from the Rotten Tomatoes Website. I use this image for displying images for movie
                            posters that do not exist.
